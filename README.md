<h2 align="center">Project Details</h2>
<b>Competency</b>
<ul>
  <li>Design the architecture of a web application</li>
  <li>Build a web application using frameworks</li>
  <li>Develop and integrate a database using frameworks</li>
</ul>
<b>Scenario</b>
<br>
You are a software developer working for a software development company. Your supervisor assigned you to build a travel booking website for a new client, Travlr Getaways. The marketing department at Travlr Getaways has provided the specs and a wireframe to guide the development of the website. Your role as a software developer is to produce a fully functional travel web application that meets Travlr Getaways’ requirements:
<br>
<br>
“We are looking to create a travel booking site for our customers to book travel packages. Our customers must be able to create an account, search for travel packages by location and price point, and book reservations with our travel agency. Customers must also be able to visit our website regularly before their trip to see their itineraries. We are also seeking to have an admin-only site where Travlr Getaways administrators are able to maintain a customer base, available trip packages, and pricing for each item and package.”

<b>Requirements</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Customer-Facing Website:</b> Develop and run a complex public customer-facing web application that meets software requirements.</li>
  <li><b>MVC Routing:</b> The customer-facing website must be an Express web application with routes, controllers, views, and data models.</li>
  <li><b>Static HTML to Templates with JSON:</b> Utilize the Handlebars templating engine to move the static HTML site to templates to render JSON data dynamically within the application.</li>
  <li><b>NoSQL Database:</b> Configure a NoSQL database using Mongoose for storing data in the server side of the software application.</li>
  <li><b>RESTful API:</b> Integrate RESTful API with a NoSQL database, which is organized using models and schemas with existing software frameworks.</li>
  <li><b>SPA:</b> Utilize frameworks to include rich functionality and features in a SPA to meet software requirements. Use the test data provided and add other examples of tours with dates and other data to test the SPA.</li>
  <li><b>Security:</b> Refactor the code to add security controls, including a login form, and apply best practices to ensure authorized access using secure endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<b>Software Used</b>
<ul>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>MongoDb</li>
<li>Angular</li>

<h2 align="center">Project Reflection</h2>
<b>Architecture</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).</i>
<br>

</li>
<li>
<i>Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?</i>
<br>

</li>
</ul>

<b>Functionality</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?</i>
<br>

</li>
<li>
<i>Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.</i>
<br>

</li>
</ul>

<b>Testing</b>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.</i>
<br>

</li>
</ul>
